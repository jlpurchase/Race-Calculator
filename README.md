# Race-Calculator
Project I designed and created to practice/learn JS.
This app allows a user who know the distance they wish to run and EITHER their current mile pace OR their desired finish time to determine training goal in two separate forms.
If the user knows their current pace, they are able to determine when they will finish a given distance/race.
If the user knows what time they'd like to complete a run/race in than the form can determine how fast their avg mile pace must be in order to complete in this given time.
